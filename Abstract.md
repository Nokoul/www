With the advent of the big data era, knowledge engineering has attracted wide attention, as mining knowledge from large-scale data is critical for big data analysis. Knowledge graph techniques provide a way to extract structured knowledge from large-scale texts and images, thus having a wide application prospect. The data of the military has a high sensitivity and confidentiality, therefore it has high value. Through a large amount of military data to achieve a human-computer interaction platform has an important strategic significance. Through the association of military equipment information, military base information and military combat force information in the form of a knowledge graph, it can not only recommend operational strategies, but also provide better training for military personnel. In this article, we realize a semantic search and question-answering system based on the military knowledge graph by crawling the semi-structured and unstructured military data, storing them in different databases and achieving knowledge fusion.
